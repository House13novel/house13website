                        <p><em>House 13</em> was written in part to help those grappling with metaphysical solipsism and existential questions about the nature of reality. The novel serves as both entertainment and a potential roadmap for those feeling lost in questions about consciousness, identity, and existence.</p>
                        
                        <p>If this work has provided comfort, insight, or companionship during your own journey of questioning, your support helps continue this exploration through future writing and research.</p>
